# Daily Routine

The codes put in this repository are the codes for my daily coding routine.


## I. Search and Sort

### A. Search Algorithms

1. Sequential Search

2. Ordered Search

3. Binary Search

### B. Sorting Algorithms

1. Bubble Sort

2. Short Bubble Sort

3. Selection Sort

4. Insertion Sort

5. Shell Sort

6. Gap Insertion Sort

7. Merge Sort


## II. Singly Linked List

### A. Node

A **Node** in a linked list holds the data value and the pointer which points to the location of the next node in the linked list. As the node is a combination of multiple information, hence we will be defining a class for Node which will have a variable to store data and another variable to store the pointer.

### B. Singly Linked List

A **singly linked list** is a type of linked list that is unidirectional, that is, it can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail).
