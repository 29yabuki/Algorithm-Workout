# <p align="center">Algorithm Workout</p>

This repository contains several data structures and algorithms meant for its implementation to be second nature. A module is to be chosen daily and coded exactly like in the source code.

Because of that nature, it is named as "Algorithm Workout".  Instead of practicing and refining fitness and athleticism, the emphasis is placed on honing one's coding abilities.

## How to Use

As part of the Algorithm Workout, a module is selected daily from the repository. 

Each day, you choose a module from the repository while ensuring it is different from the one coded the previous day. This approach promotes a diverse and comprehensive coding practice, allowing you to exercise various algorithmic skills without redundancy.

Just as a well-rounded workout routine avoids targeting the same muscle groups on consecutive days, the Algorithm Workout follows a similar principle. 

## Implementation Timeline

The following modules will be implemented in the near future:
- [x] search_sort_algorithms.py
- [x] singly_linked_list.py
- [x] data_strucs.py
- [ ] graph.py
- [ ] graph_traversal.py
- [ ] shortest_path.py
- [ ] mst.py
- [ ] disjoint_sets.py
